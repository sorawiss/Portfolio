The dataset was collected manually by the project creator and used to train a predictive model. The resulting model was then integrated into a software application. Additionally, custom software was developed to interface with the hardware component—a pressure-sensitive footpad—which is capable of measuring the user's foot length and body weight. With this system, simply standing on the pad enables users to receive instant estimations of their ideal shoe and clothing sizes.",
